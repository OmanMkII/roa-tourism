# Republic of Asia (Tourism Department)
In an alternate history, the Republic of Asia's Tourism Department is proud to present the greatest scientific discovery to date: the ability to travel through time!

This website was constructed for UQ's DECO1400 design course and focuses on design over functionality, though front-end functionality has been optimised where possible.

# Licencing
As DECO1400 (and all UQ courses) prohibit collusion with both current and past students, using code from this project will likely land you in trouble, though the design concepts are free to use so long as they are approved and referenced appropriately.

For commercial or private use, the MIT licence applies.
